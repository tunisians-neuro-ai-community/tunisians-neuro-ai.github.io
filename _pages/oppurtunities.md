## Fellowship Opportunity at UdeM

**Posted in March 2025**

The Faculty of Medicine at the University of Montreal (UdeM) has signed an agreement with Tunisian faculties to welcome highly qualified fellows for a one-year specialization program. This initiative, supported by the Dr. Sadok Besrour Foundation and UdeM International, aims to enhance clinical and teaching expertise and foster joint research projects. The first cohort, starting in 2025, will include two fellows specializing in nuclear medicine and pediatric cardiology.
