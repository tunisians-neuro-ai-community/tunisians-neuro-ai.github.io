TuNA's first meet-up is coming soon! [Location: Montreal]

The goal of the first meet-up is to launch the discussions that will shape the mission and activities organized by TuNA. In addition to getting to know each other better, we will share ideas, discuss the website and social media presence, creating a mailing-list or slack workspace, the logo design, reaching out to potential new members, event organization and sponsorships etc.
