# Members
Our main objective is to create a collaborative network of Tunisians worldwide. We encourage anyone involved in Neuroscience or AI to join and participate in our meet-ups and events. Additionally, we welcome individuals who are interested in joining the field and want to be part of this community.

# MeetUps and Events
Our meet-ups are flexible, with no fixed time or location. We convene wherever there is a gathering of Tunisian Neuro and AI enthusiasts. Additionally, we are planning to host conferences related to Neuroscience and AI in Tunisia. Everyone is welcome to join us, not just Tunisians.

# Opportunities 
This plays a vital role within our community, fostering a sense of collaboration and support. Every member has the opportunity to contribute by sharing diverse opportunities on our website. This includes internships, funding opportunities, and job openings.

# News
Explore the latest achievements and contributions of Tunisian talents in the field of Neuroscience and AI! The "News" section highlights the groundbreaking work, research findings, and success stories of Tunisians making waves in neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

# Values
We value diversity, equity, and inclusion. We are committed to fostering a community that is welcoming to all, regardless of their background, and to promoting the work of Tunisians in the fields of Neuroscience and AI.
While we are a community of Tunisians, we welcome all who share our values and are interested in joining us in our mission.

# History 
Everything has it's own origin. We clone this from nature. We therefore can trace The Origin, founding and progress of TuNA network to date. While, The Tunisians in Neuroscience and AI (TuNA) network is an initiative that was founded recently, the idea of bringing together Tunisians working in the fields of Neuroscience and AI has been in the works for a while by Dr. Karim Jerbi. With a team of dedicated students and professionals, the TuNA network was officially launched in 2024.
