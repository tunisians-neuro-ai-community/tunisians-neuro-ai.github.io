# Members
Our objective is to create a collaborative network of Tunisians worldwide. We particulalrly encourage anyone involved in the fields of Neuroscience or AI to join and participate in our activities. Additionally, we welcome individuals who are interested in joining the field and want to be part of this community.

# MeetUps and Events
Our meet-ups are informal opportunities to get-together and strengthen our community of Tunisian Neruo and AI enthusiasts. Our first meet-ups will take place in Montreal. While the times/locations for our first events are flexible, we might plan regular meet-ups in the future. Ultimately as TuNA continues to grow, meet-ups could also be organized in other cities across the globe, and of course in Tunisia. All our events are open, safe and inclusive spaces for exchange of ideas.

# Opportunities 
All TuNA members are encouraged to share diverse announcements and opportunities in the fields of Neuroscience or AI. This includes internships, funding opportunities, local or international events and job openings both in academia and in the industry. We can share these through posting on our website and/or through social media.

# News
Find out about the latest achievements and contributions of Tunisian talents in the field of Neuroscience and AI! The "News" section highlights the cutting-edge work, research findings, and success stories of Tunisians making waves in neuroscience and artificial intelligence.

# Values
We value diversity, equity, and inclusion. We are committed to fostering a community that is welcoming to all, regardless of their background, and to promoting the work of Tunisians in the fields of Neuroscience and AI.
While we are a community of Tunisians, we welcome all who share our values and are interested in joining us in our mission.

# History 
The Tunisians in Neuroscience and AI (TuNA) network was launched in 2024 by a dedicated group of students and professionals. The idea of bringing together Tunisians working in the fields of Neuroscience and AI had been in the works for a few years and originates from discussions in Dr. Karim Jerbi's Neuro-AI research lab in Montreal (Université de Montréal and Mila).
